summary: My first drupal webpage.

## Overview

The lawfirm I was working with got a quote for a webpage that was over their budget. Since I was the goto guy for anything tech related, I was asked if I could do it for cheaper.  My friend, Mark, at the time was doing graphic design and web development on the side, and I offered him the job, but he suggested we do it together.  I got the hosting information, and he setup the basic drupal theme and did some basic graphic design for the logo.  This was my first time being exposed to a content mangament system like drupal. The last time I had made a webpage CSS didn't even exist. 

After the initial setup, I worked with the lawfirm to fill in the content and dealt with the modifications that they wanted. I continued to maintain the the website after I left the lawfirm.  The most difficult part of the entire project was dealing with the clients. Each partner had their own opinions and we went through many revisions before settling on the final product.

## Experience

This project forced me to learn a lot about css and drupal on the fly.  The ease of using content managment systems and built in themes to  deploy a website surprised me.  I also was exposed to a little of the backend when I had to deal with drupal upgrades and the various DNS records. However, I think what I still remember the most is related to working as a contractor.  The tax implications, dealing with clients, and the woes of doing a project for an upfront price without a clearly defined contract are all valuable experiences.
