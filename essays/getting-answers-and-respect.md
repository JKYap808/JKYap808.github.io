## Smart Questions
  I like to follow three rules when asking questions on forums like stackoverflow.com. First, be clear and appropriate.  The better other's understand your problem, the easier and more precsiely they can answer your question, and posting in the appropriate forum section and with the approriate tags can be the minimum clarity required to get an answer.  Not only does clarity increase the quality of the answer but also decreases the time to recieve that answer.<P>
  Secondly, demonstrate effort and knowledge.  Before going on a forum to ask a question, an attempt to answer that question should have been made.  When asking your question, mention the steps you took to answer it yourself, and demonstrate your knowledge or where your knowledge fell short.  This rule has two main purposes. One, it implies that you have already looked for an answer, so people are more willing to help you. Second, if people know how you are thinking about the question, it is easier for them to point out the error in your logic or fill in the knowledge gap needed to answer the question.<P>
  Lastly, be respectful. This is the most obvious rule, and applies not just to questions but any communications that can be linked to your professional persona.  These forums are communities that can generate contacts and opportunities for your career, so put your best face forward.  These rules are not just about getting good answers but earning respect amongst your online peers.
